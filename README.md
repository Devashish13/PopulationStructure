This package implements a comprehensive PCA pipeline that utilizes PLINK, a widely used tool in genomic data analysis. The pipeline is designed based on the parameter settings discussed in the Genome Asia 100K project, ensuring robustness and relevance to contemporary genetic research.

The key features of this package include:

1. Simplified workflow: Users only need to specify the data path, metadata path, and a few other parameters.
2. Customizability: Although the default settings are derived from the Genome Asia 100K project, users can adjust parameters to suit their specific research needs.
3. Comprehensive analysis: The package includes functions for PCA computation, result visualization, and outlier detection.

The package can be installed using devtools
```
devtools::install_github("Devashish13/PopulationStructure")
```

The tutorial for using the package can be accessed in RPubs.
